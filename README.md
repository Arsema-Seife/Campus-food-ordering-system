    ## Project Overview
    
    The Campus Food Ordering System is a responsive web application designed to improve how students order food within a university environment. It offers a centralized, user-friendly platform where students can browse cafe(lounge) menus, add items to their cart, place stimulated orders, and recieve on-screen notifications when their food is "Ready" for pickup of delivery.

    This Project is currently being developed as a part of the final project for the Internet Programming I course. It aims to address common campus challenges, such as difficulty tracking multiple orders, wasting time checking cafe availabilty, and lacking timely notifications. By centralizing menus and order management, the system impoves efficiency and provides a smoother dining experience for students.

     Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project will deliver a fully interactive frontend experience, allowing students to place orders, view menus, and recieve notificatons showcasing practical skill in web development.
    
    ## Problem Statement
    
Ordering food on campus can be a frustrating experience for students due to several key issues:

1. **Fragmented Ordering Process**: Students must navigate multiple cafes, each with its own menu and order process, leading to confusing and inefficiency.
2. **Lack of Real-Time Availability**: Without a centralized system, students often struggle to track which menu items are available, resulting in wasted time and disappointment.
3. **Unclear Order Status**: Students frequently find themselves in the dark about when their orders are ready for pickup or delivery, causing unnecessary delays.
4. **Queue Management Issues**: The absence of organized system can lead to unfair practices, such as individuals jumping the line while waiting for their food, creating frustration among peers..

    ## Future Features & Notes
    ** Planned Future Features(feasible for frontend-only development):
    - Dynamic Menu Display: Menus will be tailored and dynamically generated based on each campus cafe's offerings, using JavaScript arrays and objects.
    - Shopping Cart Functionslity: Users will be an=ble to add multiple items to a cart, review their selections, abd place combined orders seamlessly.
    - Order Notifications: Real-time notifications will alert users when their orders are prepared and ready for pickup.
    - Order Tracking and Summary: The system will calculate and display total costs and qualities for all items ordered.
    - Responsive Design: The interface will be fully optimized for accessibility and usability across all screen sizes, including desktop, mobile and tablet devices.
    - Local Storage Integration: Orders and user preferances will be temporarily stored in the browser to maintain session continuity between visits.

    ** Notes:
     - The current version of this project focuses solely on frontend development.
     - All advanced functionalities are part of the project roadmap and will be implemented progressively as we continue to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
     - Future updates will include enhanced visual elements such as screenshots, data tables, and interactive user interfaces to improve user engagement and presentation quality.
